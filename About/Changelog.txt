  Changelog for "Rainbeau's Fertile Fields"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- 12/05/2018
	- Plant scraps can now be used in silage and bulk kibble recipes added by
	  "Vegetable Garden," if that mod is in use.
	- Rewrote XML patches to improve load efficiency slightly.

- 12/02/2018
	- Plant scraps now stack to 200, like hay, instead of just to 75, and are
	  once again categorized (for stockpile purposes) as food, as they can be 
	  used to feed animals.
	- Plant scraps, like hay, can now be used in the kibble recipe.
	- The options menu toggle to determine if plant scraps drop has been replaced
	  with a slider to determine how *much* scrap drops.
	- Sand piles no longer deteriorate if outside.
	- Plant cutting, just like harvesting, can now result in soil degradation.
	- Placement of moving or still water near rivers as new water tiles are
	  created is better than it was, but can still result in "glitchy" graphics
	  at the interface between the two. I'll continue trying to improve it.

- 11/04/2018
    - Patched for compatibility with yet another "VGP Garden Tools" update.
	
- 11/04/2018
	- Rock mills and compost barrels are now minifiable and movable.
	- Rock mills, like other work benches, now benefit from tool cabinets.
	
- 11/03/2018
	- Whether degraded plowed tiles, degraded rich soil tiles, and compost bins
	  leave behind blueprints are now three separate configuration options.
	- Doubled the mass of plant scraps. This will make them more efficient as
	  compost ingredients. (You'll need only five to create a pile of compost,
	  rather than 10.)
	- Harvesting plants now yields plant scraps, though not as large a quantity
	  as does plant cutting.
	- Sandbags (both regular and heavy) are now minifiable and movable.
	- The rock mill now only requires Electricity (rather than both Electricity
	  and Terraforming) to be researched. This change allows the rock mill to be
	  added to my "Concrete" mod for independent use.
	- It's now possible to create normal stone blocks at the rock mill, faster
	  and more efficiently than at a stonecutting table. (I should have thought
	  to add this long ago.)
	- Added patches so that glass from "Glass+Lights" and "Dub's Skylights"
	  is actually made from sand.

- 10/29/2019
	- Removed a stray line in the code, left over from my testing yesterday, that
	  was generating unnecessary entries in the game's log file.
	  
- 10/28/2018
	- The amount of scrap a particular plant will drop is now influenced by the
	  plant's growth amount, so you'll no longer be able to plant things and
	  immediately cut them down to quickly build up a large plant scrap supply.
	- Added a configuration option to determine whether plants actually drop
	  scraps at all.
	- Made a few adjustments to the ordering of items on the "Terraform" tab, in
	  order to prevent transformations which require research from incorrectly
	  showing up before the prerequisite research is actually complete.
	- Compost barrels now have a higher capacity, and can convert up to 30 piles
	  of compost (instead of just 10) into fertilizer per run.
	- Similarly, compost bins now require three piles of compost, instead of just
	  one, and yield three piles of fertilizer.
	- Compost bins will now leave behind blueprints for new compost bins, if the
	  "auto-refertilize" setting in the options menu is checked.
	- Compost recipe requirements are now based on total mass rather than total
	  nutritional value.
	- Rotted mush no longer has a nutritional value, so even pigs should no 
	  longer eat it (and make themselves sick as a result).
	- Rotted mush can still deteriorate, but will no longer "rot," so you'll no
	  longer have rotted mush rotting into... more rotted mush.
	- Plant scraps are now categorized (for stockpile purposes) as plant matter
	  rather than as food, and rotted mush is now categorized simply as a generic
	  raw resource.
	- It is now possible to allow the use of kibble and/or pemmican in the 
	  production of compost, though those ingredients will not be allowed by
	  default.
	  
- 10/27/2018
	- Restructured the "Terraform" tab of the Architect menu to take advantage of
	  vanilla's new "designator drop-down" groupings.
	- Fixed the bug that sometimes had plowed soil degrading directly to normal
	  soil. Hopefully, also fixed the bug that sometimes had degraded plowed soil
	  not leaving behind a blueprint when it should have.
	- Soil degradation will now leave behind blueprints only in growing zones,
	  rather than all over the map.
	- Fixed a new incompatibility created by an update to "VGP Garden Tools."
	
- 10/20/2018
	- "Fertile Fields" and "VGP Garden Tools" once again play nicely together.
	- Water from "No Water, No Life" should no longer rot into mush.
	
- 10/14/2018
	- Tweaked the "from ice" transformations to better handle modded biomes that
	  happen to contain ice.
	  
- 10/14/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld 1.0 release!
	- Rotted mush is now forbidden only if it appears outside of your home area.
	- Grass and wildflowers now produce less plant scrap than other plants.
	- Updated some of the mod's graphics (primarily to utilize StackCounts).
	
- 10/13/2018
	- Cut plants (including blighted plants) can now yield "plant scraps," which
	  can be used in composting.
	- Pawns will now haul fertilizer to tiles designated to be improved to rich
	  or plowed soil, even if they're not assigned to plant work, just as pawns
	  will haul materials to blueprints, even if not assigned to construction.
	- Cremating a corpse in a crematorium now yields 5 compost instead of 4, and
	  cremating in a campfire yields 4 compost instead of 2.
	- When items rot, the rotted mush that results is now forbidden, to prevent
	  pawns from running all over the map collecting... well, mush.
	  
- 10/10/2018
	- The chance of plowed soil degrading to rich soil when crops are harvested
	  is now a configuration option (default 100%).
	- An additional configuration option determines the chance of rich soil
	  degrading to normal soil when crops are harvested (default 50%).
	- When a soil tile degrades due to crop harvesting, it will by default be
	  flagged automatically for replowing/refertilizing before new any new crops
	  are planted. However, this behavior is also configurable, and can be turned
	  off (for example, if you're low on fertilizer and don't want farms tiles
	  sitting idle).
	- Topsoil can now be laid over ice as well as over smooth stone. This will
	  provide a potentially important new option for farming on ice sheet and sea
	  ice maps, especially if playing in the mod's new "hard mode."
	- Added a "Hard Mode" configuration option which disables the less realistic
	  terrain transformations (removing ice from ice sheet or sea ice maps, 
	  creating mud, marsh or marshy soil on those same maps, and creating or
	  removing deep ocean water on any map).

- 10/09/2018
	- Plowed soil now degrades to rich soil when crops are harvested, rather than
	  as a random time-based function.
	  
- 10/08/2018
	- Plowed soil on which no plants are growing will, in time, degrade back to
	  rich soil. The practical upshot of this change is that fields will likely
	  need to be replowed at the beginning of each growing season.
	- Basic sandbags once again have a (minimal) cloth cost.
	- It is now possible to build doors, vents and the like over brick walls,
	  just as you can over vanilla walls.
	- Herringbone brick floors now require 4 bricks instead of 3, in addition to
	  requiring more work than regular brick floors, in order to better balance
	  their beauty advantage.
	- Brick floors can no longer be built on terrain (primarily soft sand) that
	  won't support vanilla floors.
	- Converting terrain other than ice to shallow water on an ice sheet map no
	  longer has a chance of resulting in stony soil.
	  
- 09/24/2018
	- Fixed a minor bug in water terrain patching.
	
- 09/23/2018
	- Updated to RimWorld b19 release.
	- Renamed "rocky dirt" to "rough gravel," since it's a better description of
	  what the terrain is supposed to be, and since vanilla gravel is now called
	  "stony soil." It's still an important terraforming step between solid stone
	  and farmable terrain types, but it no longer generates naturally on maps.
	- Eliminated custom graphics for soil and rich soil.
	- Basic sandbags are now constructed from sand and steel instead of sand and
	  cloth, to appease those who feel the cloth cost was too restrictive in the
	  early game. Note that the steel cost is 2, as opposed to vanilla's 5.
	- Heavy sandbags now also require steel, but use less leather than before.
	- Both types of sandbags once again require regular sand piles instead of
	  "mini" sand piles. The latter no longer exist in the mod.
	- Updated the version of the Harmony library the mod uses.
	- Removed "Mod Sync Ninja" files.

- 01/20/2018
	- Hot and cold springs from "Nature's Pretty Sweet" can now be transformed
	  using any terraforming job that works on shallow water. That mod's various
	  "wet" sand and soil terrains can also now be transformed using the obvious
	  appropriate terraforming jobs.
	- The various "rocky soil" terrains found on "Biomes!" cavern maps can now
	  be transformed using any terraforming job that works on regular rocky
	  dirt.
	  
- 01/20/2018
	- Compost barrels now consume less power, and shouldn't short-circuit in the
	  rain, meaning you can actually place them outside, where they logically 
	  belong.
	- Crushed rocks now stack to 25 instead of just 5.
	- The "ice to shallow water" transformation has been replaced with a "remove
	  ice" transformation, which will yield shallow water on "sea ice" maps, and
	  either shallow water or gravel on "ice sheet" maps.
	- Converting ice to shallow water will no longer leave snow somehow sitting
	  on top of the water.
	- Sand piles can now be split into small piles (or three small piles can be
	  recombined into one regular pile) in essentially no time at all at a rock
	  mill, stonecutting table or crafting spot.
	- Sandbags now require small sand piles instead of regular sand piles, so
	  that you can make three times as many bags with the same amount of sand.
	  Hopefully, this will finally satisfy those who still complain about how
	  difficult the mod supposedly makes sandbag production.

- 01/08/2018
	- FIRST ANNIVERSARY UPDATE! "Fertile Fields" is now a year old!
	- The mod now finally works again with Fluffy's "Architect Sense," as it's
	  supposed to.
	- The transformations in the rocky dirt - sand - gravel - soil sequence have
	  been adjusted so they make a bit more sense and to correct some imbalances.
	- Transformation of ice to shallow water is no longer possible on ice sheet
	  maps, but only on sea ice maps.
	- Transforming sand to shallow water no longer has a research prerequisite.
	- Switching between shallow water and sand now requires (or provides) both
	  sand and crushed rocks.
	- The market values of sand, dirt, crushed rocks and clay have been doubled,
	  and the time required to create them has been cut to a quarter of what it
	  was before, to try to better balance the cost of buying supplies against
	  the work requirements of making them.
	- The market value of fertilizer has been increased from 1.5 to 6.
	- Fertilizer is no longer required for any "Terraform" transformations, but
	  only for "Farming" transformations.
	- Fertilizer has, however, been added as a requirement for turning rich soil
	  into plowed soil. (It may not make much sense from a "realism" perspective
	  to require fertilizer for plowing, but it works for game balance.)
	- Failure chance for "Farming" jobs (creating rich soil, plowing soil, etc.)
	  is now linked to a pawn's Growing skill rather than to Construction skill.
	- Added Russian language translation files provided by fox_kirya.

- 12/04/2017
	- The mod now works with the "Mod Sync Ninja" updater.

- 11/24/2017
	- Minor update to accommodate my "Concrete" mod's new independence.

- 11/23/2017
	- It's now possible to make crushed rocks from stone blocks as well as from
	  stone chunks.
	- Crushed rocks, dirt, sand and clay are now heavier, and have lower stack
	  limits.
	- Dirt and clay no longer deteriorate noticeably when left outside. Piles of
	  sand still deteriorate, but more slowly than before.
	- Skeletons should no longer turn to rotted mush, preventing your pawns from
	  running all over the map collecting the stuff.
	- Added icons for use with the "Architect Icons" mod.
	- Updated Korean and German language files.
	- Added French translation files provided by Steam user Redstylt.

- 11/19/2017
	- Growers not assigned to construction will no longer haul materials to
	  construction blueprints. Similarly, pawns assigned to construction but not
	  to growing will no longer haul materials to growing-based terraforming
	  blueprints.

- 11/18/2017
	- Updated "Vegetable Garden" compatibility.
	- Fixed the bug where multiple pawns would try to reserve the same
	  terraforming job and generate error messages.
	- Added Korean translation files provided by Ludeon forums user NEPH.

- 11/15/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld b18 release.
	- Got rid of "rotted meat." Meat and vegetables alike now just deteriorate
	  into "rotted mush."
	- For simplicity's sake, compost no longer requires both meat and vegetable
	  products. You can use just one or the other, or both in combination.
	- Removed the "rotted material only" compost recipes, since if a player
	  prefers to use only rotted material, it's possible to simply limit the 
	  regular compost recipes to accept only "rotted mush" as an ingredient.
	- It is once again possible to make dirt at a rock mill as well as at a
	  crafting spot.
	- Terrain transformations on the "Terraform" menu now consistently provide
	  Construction experience, regardless of whether materials are needed.
	- Terrain transformations on the "Farming" menu are now all Growing (plant
	  work) jobs, and provide Growing experience.
	- The ice to shallow water transformation no longer requires Terraforming.
	  It doesn't really take much research to figure out how to cut a hole in
	  the ice, after all.
	- Reduced or eliminated the need for fertilizer in a number of terrain
	  transformations.

- 08/22/2017
	- Added the ability to terraform custom terrains from the "Crashlanding,"
	  "Quarry" and "Tiberium Rim" mods.
	- It is now possible to make crushed rocks from stone chunks, and sand from
	  crushed rocks, at a stonecutting table, though doing so is of course much
	  slower than at a rock mill.

- 08/05/2017
	- It is now possible to extract sand and clay from dirt at a rock mill as
	  well as at a crafting spot. Maybe now people will remember that the recipe
	  exists. ;)
	- It is now possible, as well, to convert dirt directly to clay at either a
	  crafting spot or a rock mill. The yield is lower than if you first split
	  the dirt into sand and clay and then as a separate step grind the sand into
	  more clay, but the recipe allows for automation of bulk clay production.
	- It is possible to fire bricks in a smelter, now, with a small gain in speed
	  as compared to firing them in a smithy.
	- Creating compost now utilizes the cooking skill, consistent with the fact
	  that it falls under the Cooking work type.

- 07/29/2017
	- Mud is now an optional step between soil and marshy soil; both of those 
	  terrains can be converted to mud, and mud can be converted to either of
	  them.
	- It is now possible to convert marsh directly to soil, instead of having to
	  do it with marshy soil as an intermediate step.
	- Added a herringbone pattern brick floor for a bit of variety.
	- Replaced the code-based deletion of VG items with XML patches. On the down
	  side, if you're using "Vegetable Garden," your log file will now be spammed
	  when you load the game with yellow "def-linked translation error" warning
	  messages. On the up side, the VG items I want deleted should now actually
	  stay deleted.

- 07/25/2017
	- There are now two types of sandbags. Standard sandbags are made with cloth
	  and sand, while heavy sandbags are more durable, and are made with leather
	  instead of cloth.
	- Corrected a stupid mistake that was causing all rock chunks created by
	  stone to rocky dirt terraform actions to be granite.

- 07/24/2017
	- Sandbags now require less cloth (10 instead of 50), and can be constructed
	  with leather if cloth's not available.
	- Sandbags can now be minified and moved. Which makes sense, since sandbags
	  are by definition not "permanent" fixtures.
	- Most non-wall items that can be built from stone blocks can now again be
	  built from bricks, as well.

- 07/22/2017
	- The "cremate for compost" recipe again allows animal corpses to be used,
	  but requires a minimum total mass of 50 kg, so a single squirrel corpse,
	  for example, can't be cremated for the same yield as a human corpse.

- 07/21/2017
	- Sandbags are now made from sand and cloth instead of from steel.
	- It is now possible to convert ice to shallow water.
	- Brick walls and floors now have unique textures with white mortar, so they
	  actually look more like real brick walls. The color has also been "toned
	  down" a bit. (Note that brick walls constructed prior to this upgrade will
	  retain the old, standard block wall texture.)
	- Brick walls and floors now cost slightly less to build than their stone
	  block counterparts, both in terms of resources and in terms of effort.
	- The recipe to cremate a corpse for compost now actually defaults to allow
	  humanlike (and only humanlike) corpses to be used, as it should have all
	  along.
	- The compost yield from cremating corpses has been cut about in half.
	- The mod's custom soil and rich soil textures are now less overpoweringly
	  reddish in color.
	- Dirt, fertilizer, compost and sand piles now deteriorate more slowly.
	- If Fluffy's "ArchitectSense" mod is installed, the Terraform menu will be
	  more compact and easier to navigate, utilizing submenus. Otherwise, the
	  Terraform menu will be unchanged from the previous version.
	- The mod now treats the packed dirt terrain added by "TropiCKAPP" (a
	  rainforest mod) exactly the same as it treats vanilla packed dirt.
	- If Dub's "Hygiene" mod is in use, "night soil" can be terraformed with the
	  same options that can terraform marshy soil.
	- The code related to terraforming has been streamlined, as per suggestions
	  made by NotFood. As a side effect, terraforming functions are now fully
	  configurable from within the XML defs of the relevant "buildings."
	- Finally replaced the detour of the CompRottable method with a Harmony
	  patch. Thanks again to NotFood for showing me how!
	- Added German language translation files provided by Ryder32x.

- 06/18/2017
	- Added clay to the mod. Clay can be gained by extracting it from dirt (which
	  actually provides both clay and sand), or by further grinding sand at a
	  rock mill.
	- Creating dirt now requires sand and clay instead of sand and crushed rocks.
	- Creation of dirt (and extraction of sand and clay from dirt) is now done at
	  a crafting spot rather than at a rock mill. Rock mills are for grinding
	  things.
	- Clay can be baked into bricks in a smithy, which can then be used to make
	  walls and other items which can be constructed from stone blocks.
	- Added the ability to convert soil to packed dirt.
	- Sand can now be converted to shallow water if it's near existing water,
	  even if it isn't directly adjacent to water.
	- Terraforming resources (dirt, sand, and crushed rocks) are again available
	  from bulk traders, but hopefully only at more reasonable quantities.
	- Terraforming resources might also be available from visitors, though in
	  substantially smaller quantities than from bulk traders.

- 06/11/2017
	- Got the pesky "fertilizer machine" to finally leave the Production menu.
	  The interfacing between "Fertile Fields" and "Vegetable Garden" is finally
	  now working completely, 100% as intended. Seriously. I promise!

- 06/06/2017
	- Compost barrel "inspect strings" should no longer generate errors when the
	  temperature is extreme.
	- XML defs no longer try to inherit from core abstracts. (It probably wasn't
	  creating any problems, anyway, but it's better this way.)
	- Further tweaked "Vegetable Garden" interfacing and XML patches.

- 06/04/2017
	- Converting sand to shallow water will now leave behind piles of sand, as
	  it's supposed to.
	- You should no longer be pestered by error messages informing you that the
	  game tried to place a rotted item on a null map.
	- Rotted meat and mush are now recognized by the game (for filter purposes,
	  primarily) as rotted items.
	- The default soil and rich soil graphics can now be found in the mod's
	  "Textures" folder. If you prefer the vanilla look, simply rename Soil.png
	  and SoilRich.png to replace RFF_Soil.png and RFF_SoilRich.png.
	- Cleaned up some behind-the-scenes mistakes I made in updating to a17. These
	  changes will, unfortunately, break saves. I apologize. 
	- Added "[RF]" prefix tag to the mod's name for easier mod list sorting.

- 05/30/2017
	- Rock mills can actually be used now.
	- The "make dirt" recipe is now named "make dirt x2," as it actually produces
	  two piles of dirt. Similarly, the "make dirt x5" recipe has been renamed
	  "make dirt x10."
	- Cleaned up the patch XML a bit.
	- Cleaned up a few spots where the interface with "Vegetable Garden" wasn't
	  as neat as it should have been, and got rid of a few annoying (but
	  inconsequential) error messages that were being generated.

- 05/29/2017
	- Updated to RimWorld alpha 17.
	- It is now possible to convert bodies to compost in a crematorium.
	- Crushing rocks, creating dirt, and similar activities are now done at a
	  rock mill rather than at a stonecutting table. Rock mills can be built once
	  "Terraforming" has been researched, and require electricity.
	- The new packed dirt "road" terrain can be broken up to form soil.
	- Added "pile of sand" as a resource. Sand can be obtained from beaches or
	  deserts, or by further crushing crushed rocks.
	- Digging up gravel now yields both crushed rocks and dirt.
	- Creating dirt now requires both crushed rocks and sand, in addition to
	  fertilizer.
	- Added "bulk" recipes for dirt, sand and crushed rock creation.
	- Added the ability to convert between sand and shallow water at beaches.
	- Piles of dirt, sand, compost or fertilizer will now deteriorate if left
	  outside.
	- Building hydroponics basins now requires fertilizer as well as steel and
	  components.
	- Simplified the research tree to just two research projects: "Farming"
	  (which allows plowing and laying topsoil) and "Terraforming" (which, of
	  course, allows bulk terrain restructuring).
	- Split the "Terraform" tab of the architect menu into two tabs, "Terraform"
	  and "Farming."
 	- Redesigned the UI icons for terrain changes.
	- Some defNames have been changed, primarily to allow RFF terraforming to
	  cleanly replace "Vegetable Garden" terraforming, if the two mods are used
	  together.
	- Compost barrels finally actually require power as they were supposed to
	  from the beginning. Without power, they will still function, but less
	  efficiently than compost bins.
	- Traders may still buy or sell fertilizer, but they'll no longer fill up
	  their wagons or cargo holds with huge quantities of dirt, compost, and the
	  like.
	- Overrides of vanilla terrain defs now utilize XML patches, which should
	  reduce incompatibility issues with other mods.
	- Got rid of mid-depth water, as it really served no purpose.
	- Got rid of the mod's distinction between fresh and salt water, since the
	  vanilla game now defines fresh water, river water and ocean water
	  separately, anyway.
 
- 04/23/2017
	- The mod now uses the Harmony library instead of detouring core methods.
	  Partly. I haven't yet figured out how to handle rotting items without an
	  actual code detour. And map generation methods are still replaced, though
	  technically it's not via detours, since XML files were just changed to
	  point to different methods.

- 04/16/2017
	- Rough-hewn stone can now be converted to rocky soil without needing to be
	  smoothed first.
	- Stone chunks can now be broken up at a stonecutter's table into crushed
	  rocks, which can be used to create piles of dirt or to recreate rough stone
	  floor from rocky dirt.
	- Yes, rocky dirt can now be converted back into rough stone flooring. (Don't
	  ask how. Maybe you're gluing all the stones back together?)
	- Converting soil to sand now yields two piles of dirt.
	- Soil has been recolored slightly to better differentiate it from gravel and
	  also to make the difference between regular and rich soil not quite so
	  glaring.
	- The recipe to make compost solely from rotted matter no longer cares what
	  sort of rotted material you're using. (The regular compost recipe still
	  requires both meat and vegetable matter.)
	- I've added recipes allowing you to make five compost at the same time, to
	  speed up bulk compost creation.
	- Fresh and salt water are now defined separately. This is a completely
	  invisible change if you're using "Fertile Fields" by itself, but will allow
	  other mods that care about water types to know whether a water tile should
	  be treated as ocean (salt) or lake (fresh) water.

- 03/19/2017
	- Compost has been renamed raw compost, and now requires both animal and
	  vegetable matter for its creation. Required quantities are higher than
	  before, equivalent to the amount used to make one and a half meals, and are
	  now based on nutrition value rather than simple item count.
	- Rottable organic material now eventually becomes "rotted meat" or "rotted
	  mush" instead of just disappearing. Rotted material can be used in the
	  creation of raw compost.
	- Added a secondary raw compost recipe which uses only rotted material, for
	  those who want to be able to set up a "forever" compost creation bill at
	  the butcher's table that won't use up their supplies of actual food.
	- Compost barrels can no longer be built until electricity has been
	  researched, since they require power.
	- Tilled soil has been renamed plowed soil. (The name of the tillage research
	  hasn't been changed, though, as "tillage" is a general term which can refer
	  to many sorts of soil agitation.)
	- Both topsoil and fertilized topsoil, when removed with the "remove floor"
	  command, now leave behind dirt, so you no longer lose the dirt originally 
	  used to lay the topsoil just because you choose to fertilize it. But 
	  neither leaves behind fertilizer that could be reused.

- 03/10/2017
	- Allowed for compatibility with non-vanilla stone types (when breaking up
	  stone to create rocky dirt) from the "Minerals and Materials" and "Kura's
	  Extra Minerals" mods.
	- Added a "Getting Started" text file to the mod's "About" folder, for the
	  benefit of those wanting a "how to" guide to using "Fertile Fields" for the
	  first time.

- 03/05/2017
	- Fixed marshes so they can again be built on shallow water and mud.
	- Made some adjustments to allow "Fertile Fields" and "Vegetable Garden" to
	  coexist. But while they're mechanically compatible, they remain in some
	  respects conceptually incompatible.

	- Rocky dirt can now be constructed on either rough or smooth stone, costs a
	  pile of dirt, and has a chance of yielding a chunk of the appropriate stone
	  type.
	- As a side effect of the above, it's no longer possible to construct rocky
	  dirt on floors, which never should have been possible, anyway.
	- Converting deep water to shallow water now costs dirt, and converting
	  shallow to deep produces it.
	- Made some "behind the scenes" adjustments to improve backward save
	  compatibility and to prevent further usage of old terrain defs.

- 02/21/2017
	- Finally, belatedly, fixed the broken saves from the 02/04/2017 update.

- 02/20/2017
	- Removed plant cultivation into a separate mod, "Wild Cultivation."
	- Deep water is now called impassable water, and breakwater, which is no
	  longer impassable, is now deep water.
	- It's now possible to create impassable water on the map, though I still
	  think it's a terribly overpowered ability.
	- Rocky soil is renamed rocky dirt, which better reflects the fact that it
	  isn't really soil yet, but needs to be improved.
	- Map generation has been modified so that all three water depths are
	  generated on new maps, as is rocky dirt.
	- The colors of the three water tiles have been adjusted, as has the color of
	  rich soil, which now stands out better from regular soil.
	- Dirt, compost and fertilizer now have higher (and much more reasonable)
	  market values.
	- Architect menu icons for terraforming options now explain more clearly and
	  consistenty what they do.
	- Added language localization file support.

- 02/12/2017
	- Dirt piles are now obtained by digging up soil, which converts the soil
	  (depending upon how much dirt you get) either to gravel or to rocky soil.
	- Deep water tiles can now be converted to breakwaters, using a lot of dirt 
	  and a lot of effort. Breakwater tiles can be converted to shallow water
	  tiles, just as can marsh tiles.
	- Adjusted dirt/fertilizer requirements for a few terrain alterations.
	- Compost bins now have a chance to return the wood used to create them, 
	  once they're done converting compost to fertilizer.
	- Renamed "advanced terrain reclamation" to "terraforming."
	- Eliminated the old "infinite dirt" soil pits (but made sure this time that
	  the change wouldn't break any saves).
	- Gave up on trying to fix broken saves from last week's update. Sincere
	  apologies for the inconvenience.

- 02/07/2017
	- Revised agave to make it less of a superplant.
	- Hopefully fixed the issue with saves breaking after the previous update.

- 02/04/2017
	- Eliminated terrains that were functionally identical to vanilla terrains.
	- Renamed the architect tab from "fertile fields" to "terraform."
	- It's now possible to create shallow water tiles from marsh, sand from most
	  any soil type, and rocky soil (a new terrain which can be further refined
	  into gravel) from smooth stone, with Advanced Terrain Reclamation.
	- Boosted tilled soil from 160% to 180% fertility.
	- Compost bins can now be built in bulk over an area, not just in a line.
	- Tilled soil no longer features random scattered rocks.
	- It's now possible to plant agave, astragalus, grass, and both pincushion
	  and saguaro cacti. No, this doesn't relate directly to the core point of
	  the mod, but it's an idea I liked, and it didn't seem terribly out of 
	  place here.

- 01/29/2017
	- Bug fix: shallow water tiles can now actually be reclaimed as soil.

- 01/28/2017
	- Added compost barrels as an alternative to compost bins.

- 01/23/2017
	- Hay can now be used in creation of compost.

- 01/19/2017
	- Topsoil can now be fertilized (but still can't be tilled).

- 01/15/2017
	- Topsoil is now removable, returning tiles to smooth stone.
	- Soil pits and compost bins now impede movement through their tiles.
	- Tillage now requires 140% fertility, preventing 100% to 160% jumps.
	- Adv Terrain Reclamation now also allows creation of marshlike muck.

- 01/14/2017
	- Squashed a couple of bugs related to reclaimed soil.

- 01/13/2017
	- Fertilization of gravel or marshy soil to the fertility of regular soil,
	  and fertilization of regular soil to the fertility of rich soil, are now
	  separate processes.
	- Gravel and marshy soil can't be tilled without first being fertilized.
	- Tilling no longer requires fertilizer.

- 01/12/2017
	- Fixed minor bug. (Reclaimed soil wasn't requiring tech.)

- 01/12/2017
	- The recipe which originally made fertilizer now makes compost. 
	- Added compost bins, which after a delay become fertilizer.
	- Added advanced terrain reclamation research option and reclaimed soil.
	- Gravelly soil was renamed topsoil, and its fertility was increased to 100%.
	- It is no longer possible to fertilize or till topsoil.

- 01/08/2017
	- Initial release.
